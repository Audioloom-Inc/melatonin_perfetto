## Melatonin Perfetto

Sounds like an ice cream flavor (albeit a sleepy one).

However, it's just a way to use the amazing [Perfetto](http://perfetto.dev) performance tracing in JUCE.

## Why Perfetto?

The short answer: It lets you acurately measure different parts of your code and visualize it over time.

When you have performance concerns, general profiling is a great first step, and one worth famaliarizing yourself with. But it's very hand-wavey, pretty much only good for drunkenly pointing you to "the one hotspot, I think". Everything is aggregate. Everything is relative. 

Perfetto lets you get down the cold hard absolute facts: which functions are take how many Âµs/ms. How often are those functions being called, how does it look across time.

Perfetto is perfect for measuring paint calls because you can see how many times they are occur and what the timing is for each occurance. 

Perfetto is the successor to [`chrome://tracing`](https://slack.engineering/chrome-tracing-for-fun-and-profit/). 

## How to install

You can add this project as a git submodules:

```
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_perfetto.git modules/melatonin_perfetto
```

The CMake setup for Perfetto itself is a bit hairy, not going to lie. 

I had to dig deep to get it happy on MSVC. This is what my working config looks like:

```
Include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    Perfetto
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/perfetto
    GIT_TAG v25.0)
FetchContent_Populate(Perfetto)
include_directories(${perfetto_SOURCE_DIR}/sdk)
add_library(perfetto STATIC ${perfetto_SOURCE_DIR}/sdk/perfetto.cc)
target_compile_definitions(perfetto PUBLIC NOMINMAX=1 WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN=1)
set_target_properties(perfetto PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)
if(MSVC)
    target_compile_options(perfetto PRIVATE "/bigobj")
endif()
```

Then you can add this project as a JUCE module:

```
juce_add_module("modules/melatonin_perfetto")
```

Don't forget to link perfetto to your plugin target too:
```
target_link_libraries(YourPlugin PRIVATE Perfetto)
```

Phew. That was the hard part.

## How to use

### Add a few pieces of guarded code to your plugin
Put this in PluginProcessor's constructor:

```
#if PERFETTO
    MelatoninPerfetto::get().beginSession();
#endif
```
and in your destructor:
```
#if PERFETTO
    MelatoninPerfetto::get().endSession();
#endif
```
And as a member of the plugin processor:
```
#if PERFETTO
    std::unique_ptr<perfetto::TracingSession> tracingSession;
#endif
```
### Pepper around some sweet sweet macros

Unlike with profiling, you'll have to opt functions in to being measured

Pepper around `TRACE_DSP()` or `TRACE_COMPONENT()` macros. 

Or use perfetto's raw `TRACE_EVENT()` 

### Enable profiling

When you want to profile, set `#define PERFETTO 1` (somewhere before you first include the module, as a preprocessor directive, or just toggle in the module header if you are lazy like me). That'll actually include the google lib. When it's not defined, the `TRACE_DSP` calls will be no-ops, so you can just leave them in place with no impact to your app.

### Run your app and perform the actions you want traced

When you quit your app, a trace file will be dumped 

**(Note: don't just terminate it via your IDE, the file will be only dumped on a graceful quit)**.

Find the trace file and drag it into https://ui.perfetto.dev

### That's it

You can keep the macros peppered around in your app during normal dev/release. Just remember to `#define PERFETTO 0` so everything gets turned into a no-op. 

That's handy for future you!

## Options

By default, there are two "categories" defined, dsp and components. 

The current fuction name is passed as the name. You can add custom parameters if you need to further differentiate. 

You can also use the built in `TRACE_EVENT` which takes a name if you don't want it to derive a name based on the function.

Go wild! 

```
TRACE_DSP("startSample", startSample, "numSamples", numSamples);
```

## Assumptions / Caveats

* On Mac, the trace is dumped to your Downloads folder. On Windows, it's dumped to your Desktop (sorry not sorry).
* Traces are set to in memory, 8MB max

## Misc

Get warned by your tests if someone left `PERFETTO=1` on with a test like this (this example is Catch2):

```c++
TEST_CASE ("Perfetto not accidentally left enabled", "[perfetto]")
{
#if defined(PERFETTO) && PERFETTO
    FAIL_CHECK ("PERFETTO IS ENABLED");
#else
    SUCCEED ("PERFETTO DISABLED");
#endif
}
```
